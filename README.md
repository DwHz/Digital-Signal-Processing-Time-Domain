# Digital-Signal-Processing-Time-Domain
Time domain signal processing is a collection of methods for operating on and analyzing signals directly in the time dimension. Unlike frequency domain or time-frequency domain processing, time domain processing acts directly on the original form of the signal and does not require domain transformation.
